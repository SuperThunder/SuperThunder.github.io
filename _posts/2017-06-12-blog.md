# Making a Python CLI reader for a story collection
As I was reading through this collection of [sysadmin horror stories](http://www-uxsup.csx.cam.ac.uk/misc/horror.txt) and often lost my place it struck me it must be easy to make a simple command line viewer to show one story at a time. 

The stories have a fairly simple format, very usefully delimited by 77 dashes between each story.
This makes it fairly easy to split to stories up by doing a 
    Python:
    text.split('-'*77)

Here is an example story:

    My mistake on SunOS (with OpenWindows) was to try and clean up all the
    '.*' directories in /tmp. Obviously "rm -rf /tmp/*" missed these, so I
    was very careful and made sure I was in /tmp and then executed
    "rm -rf ./.*".

    I will never do this again. If I am in any doubt as to how a wildcard
    will expand I will echo it first.

An appreciable amount of space in the stories can be taken up by email information (to/from/re/org).
Quotes can also take up a lot of space. Sometimes the quotes are new and interesting, but sometimes they've been quoted several times already. Additionally, There's all that article information above the quote taking up space.  To effectively use terminal space we can add options to the program to remove email header information.
