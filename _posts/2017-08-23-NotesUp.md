title: "Notes Up: Markdown Journal and Note Taking Application"
date: 2017-08-23

I was trying out ElementaryOS last week and discovered one of the apps in its appstore is a great Markdown-based notebook. For quick notes I usually find a plain text file to be too limiting, but the complexity and power of a full system like OneNote, KDE Basket, or Zim gets in the way of just writing something down in a structured format.
The feature that sold me on Notes Up is the ability to very quickly switch between a "View" mode and an "Edit" mode. In edit mode you see your markdown text with a nice level of syntax highlighting. One click from there to view mode and it renders the markdown text, including scaling to the window size. I was using Notes Up on a low power netbook (AMD E2-1800) and did not notice any lag. The minimal interface also suited the small screen size.

## Installing on Ubuntu
While Notes Up installs on Elementary with no difficulties, installing it on Ubuntu requires the addition of several ElementaryOS PPAs (one for the app, and then two for dependencies). From start to finish:

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:elementary-os/daily
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:elementary-os/os-patches
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:philip.scott/notes-up
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install com.github.philip-scott.notes-up
